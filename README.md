This readme file will help replicate the results in the paper titled: "Stability of schooling patterns of a fish pair swimming against a flow".

Directory “/Code/” contains all the codes required to replicate the results of this work.

The programs and functions are detailed below:
## “SampleSimulations.m”: 
This code calculates and plots sample trajectories for specified initial conditions.
## “Find_AllRoots_alph.m”:
This code finds the equilibria of the system of equations at different values of alpha for a given value of lambda.
## “Plot_equil_vs_alph.m”:
This code plots the cross-stream coordinate (xi) of stable/unstable equilibria of the system as a function of the flow parameter alpha. 
## “Find_AllRoots_lam_alph.m”:
This code finds the equilibria of the system of equations at different values of alpha and lambda.
## “Plot_heatmap.m”:
This code plots the heatmap of the stable configurations of the system in alpha-lambda plane.
## “Write_nat_freq.m”:
This code computes the natural frequencies of stable equilibria at different values of alpha-lambda.
## “Plot_nat_freq.m”:
